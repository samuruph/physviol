"""Every culprit stays in shot, at every tier.

The regression this exists for: when the tiers were lengthened (13 -> 25 frames
at the debug tier, 25 -> 49 at tier v0) every camera in the project stayed where it had
been hand-tuned for the short clips, while the distance a body covers grew with
the clip. `toss` and `tumble` were the worst -- a ballistic arc's apex goes as
`g*T^2/8`, so quadrupling -- and ended up with 1% and 0% of their frames still
in view at tier v0. `collision`, `barrier_pass`, `occluder_pass`, `rolling_ramp`
and `shadow_track` all leaked out sideways for the linear version of the same
reason.

None of it was caught by anything. Every cell still planned, still applied,
still validated and still rendered; the violations were simply injected
off-screen, which is the one failure mode a green test suite is least able to
notice. So the framing gets a test of its own, and it runs at all three tiers
rather than the one we happen to be debugging at.

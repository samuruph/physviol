"""Every build cell plans, applies and keeps its prefix -- without docker.

The coverage check that runs in a second instead of an hour. It cannot say
whether a violation looks right; it says that no cell is dead, that no injector
crashes on a scenario it has never seen, and that the four structural
guarantees hold everywhere: a plan exists, its windows are legal, the invalid
trajectory is bit-identical before `t_event`, and something actually changed
after it.

    annotated one alone. The clip came out identical to its valid twin with a

    Narrowed from "no non-culprit array differs" to the appearance channels

    that turned out to be the wrong invariant: when an intervention prevents a
    collision, the body that *was* going to be struck has to be re-settled, or
    it departs on schedule hit by nothing. See

"""The union rule -- docs/PLAN.md 3.3.

    violation_mask[t] = footprint(culprit, invalid, t) | footprint(culprit, valid, t)

Without it, vanish- and teleport-type violations produce empty or half-empty
masks: the body has no invalid-side pixels precisely *because* it vanished. A
regression here silently empties the masks on a sixth of the taxonomy, so this
tests the rule directly rather than only through a rendered clip.

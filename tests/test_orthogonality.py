"""Each cell must depict ONE violation.

The dataset's whole value proposition is that a benchmark can ask "can this
model detect a teleport" and score it on clips where a teleport is the only
thing wrong. That property is not free and it is not stable: it broke four
separate times while the injectors were being written, always the same way --
an injector re-integrates a body, the integrator does not know about the walls,
and a clip labelled `global_gravity` quietly becomes a clip about solidity too.

So it is asserted rather than hoped for. `taxonomy.EXCLUSIVE_LAWS` names the six
laws with a clean zero baseline on a lawful clip and the families entitled to
move each one; every other family must leave them where the valid twin left
them.

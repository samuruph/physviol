"""Interventions that are staged in the simulator produce REAL contacts.

The defect this exists to catch, reported cell by cell: a teleported ball
bouncing off a barrier it had already been moved past, and two balls exchanging
momentum without touching. Both came from the same cause -- the trajectory was
edited after the fact and re-integrated against the scene as *declared*, so the
resolver kept a wall in front of a body that was behind it, and wrote collision
outcomes for contacts that never occurred.

Only re-simulation can pass these. A hand-rolled resolver cannot, which is the
point of the test.

Needs worker output, so it skips without docker.

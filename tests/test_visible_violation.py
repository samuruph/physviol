"""Every built cell must depict something a viewer can see.

Your rule, made checkable: "if some invalid doesn't make sense because it is not
changing anything or it is not a visible violation, let's just skip it for that
specific scenario". A cell that carries a full set of labels describing a
violation the video does not contain is worse than a cell that does not exist --
it teaches a model that nothing is something.

Runs against a generated release, so it skips without one. `physviol audit`
prints the same measurement in a readable form.

# PhysViol

**A spatio-temporally annotated physics-violation video dataset.** Every clip that breaks a
physical law ships with *where in the frame*, *exactly when*, *for how long*, and *how badly*
— all derived from the simulator, not from human annotation.

> **Status: every build cell generates, annotates and validates.** 15 scenarios × 24
> violation families compose through the trajectory seam, and `physviol generate` walks the
> whole matrix in one command. Each clip depicts *one* violation — that is asserted, not
> hoped for; see [§7](#7-orthogonality-what-the-labels-guarantee).

## 1. Setup (once)

```bash
# Host environment: annotation, severity, grids, validation, viz.
# Does NOT contain Kubric/Blender/PyBullet -- those live in the docker image.
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate physviol

# The render image (digest pinned in docker/IMAGE_DIGEST)
docker pull kubricdockerhub/kubruntu

# Optional: read-only Kubric source for reference (gitignored)
bash scripts/fetch_refs.sh
```

**Two environments, never mixed.** The pinned container holds Kubric 2022.4.1 / Blender
2.93.4 / PyBullet (Python 3.9) and does simulation + rendering. The `physviol` conda env
(Python 3.11) does everything else. They meet at the trajectory seam (`traj.npz`).

---

## 2. The runs

Three configs, one command each. `conda activate physviol` first.

| | config | what it is | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **review** | `configs/review.yaml` | every cell once, `strong`, 128², 25 f | **~25 min** |
| **v0** | `configs/v0_release.yaml` | 512², 30 fps, 89 f (2.97 s), all three bins, 3 variants | ~6.4 days |
| **v1** | `configs/v1_release.yaml` | **same geometry as v0**, photographic (L1) + multi-object | weeks |

### The review sweep — run this before anything else

Every scenario × family cell once, at debug size, `strong` only. This is the run to look at
when you want to know whether the dataset is right.

```bash
bash scripts/run.sh
```

That generates, validates, and builds every video: `coverage.mp4`, a `sheet` per scenario and
a `grid` per family. Then open `out/release/coverage.mp4` first.

The same thing by hand, if you want the steps separately:

```bash
python -m physviol.cli generate --config review
python -m physviol.cli validate out/release
python -m physviol.cli coverage out/release
```

### The v0 release

**Price it before you start it** — `taxonomy` reads the same config, so it sizes exactly the
run `generate` would perform.

```bash
python -m physviol.cli taxonomy --config v0_release
bash scripts/run.sh v0_release
```

### The v1 release

```bash
python -m physviol.cli taxonomy --config v1_release
bash scripts/run.sh v1_release
```

**Complexity is the expensive dial, not the severity ladder.** L1's photographic environment
costs roughly 5.5× an L0 render, which is the whole difference between v0 and v1's wall
clock. The ladder is nearly free, because the valid twin and the scene build are shared
across bins.

---

## 2b. Narrowing a run

Everything below overrides whatever config you pass, so `--config review --scenario drop`
is the review settings on one scenario.

```bash
# ONE cell -- the fastest loop there is, ~14 s
python -m physviol.cli generate --config review --scenario occluder_pass --family permanence

# every family one scenario supports, in a single container run
python -m physviol.cli generate --config review --scenario drop

# one family everywhere it is meaningful
python -m physviol.cli generate --config review --family solidity

# stop after N cells, for a smoke test
python -m physviol.cli generate --config review -n 6

# the review matrix at release resolution
python -m physviol.cli generate --config review --tier v0
```

`--keep-going` carries on past a cell that fails and lists the failures at the end; the
shipped configs set it.

### Parallelism

`--workers N` runs N container jobs at once. A job is one `(variant, scenario)` — so
parallelism only helps when a run spans several scenarios or several variants, and
`--scenario drop` on its own is a single job however high you set N.

**Output is byte-identical at any worker count**: each job writes its own directory, and the
per-clip rng is keyed by `(seed, family, severity)` through `crc32`, never by position in a
queue. Verified by hashing all 295 files of a run at `--workers 1` against the same run at
`--workers 4` — zero differences. Results are also printed in job order rather than
completion order, so two runs produce the same transcript.

### Config files

Every subcommand takes `--config NAME`, reading `configs/<NAME>.yaml`. **A flag you type
always beats the file.** A config is a `defaults:` block plus one block per subcommand;
keys are the long flag names with dashes as underscores (`--keep-going` is `keep_going`).
Anything both `generate` and `taxonomy` understand lives in `defaults:` once — which is why
`taxonomy --config X` prices exactly what `generate --config X` would build.

`configs/review.yaml` documents every available key and its alternatives inline. An unknown
key under a command's own block is an error, not a warning. `PHYSVIOL_CONFIG=review` in the
environment does the same as passing `--config review`.

### Randomisation

**`--variants N` is the randomisation knob.** Each variant is a fresh seed, and a seed drives
every free parameter a scenario has: sizes, speeds, drop heights, restitution, colours, the
HDRI environment at L1, the camera position and aim, the lamp direction, and — where it is
physically neutral — whether the actor is a sphere or a cube. So six variants of `drop ×
solidity` are six visibly different clips of the same violation, not one clip with a
different random number in the filename.

One valid clip serves every family of the same scenario and seed: the twins are bit-identical
by construction, so rendering it once is both correct and cheaper. `validate` expects exactly
that shape — one `valid` and one or more `invalid` per `pair_uid`.

---

## 3. Look at what came out

**Nothing writes image files.** The container has no ffmpeg, so it writes arrays and every
mp4 is encoded host-side by `physviol/viz/video.py`.

```bash
# five-panel annotated video for ONE clip
python -m physviol.cli overlay out/release/clips/physviol_v0/drop/0777/invalid_solidity_strong

# the valid clip beside every severity bin of one family
python -m physviol.cli grid out/release/clips/physviol_v0/drop/0777 --family solidity

# ONE video tiling every invalid clip in the release -- the coverage check
python -m physviol.cli coverage out/release
```

`coverage.mp4` is the one to open first after a sweep: every cell at once, each tile captioned
with its scenario, family and observability lag, so a broken cell is obvious at a glance.

### Reading the overlay

| element | meaning |
|---|---|
| **red dot**, top right | the violation is active on *this* frame |
| **RGB** | the clip as released |
| **MASK** | red = `violation_mask` (the annotation); **green outline** = `reference_mask`, where the object *should* be per the valid twin |
| **SEVERITY MAP** | the residual painted into the culprit, with a live 0..1 scale |
| **CAUSAL MASK** | red = primary culprit, blue = other participants |
| **DIVERGENCE** | `\|valid - invalid\|` — shipped for analysis, **not** ground truth |
| red bar, timeline | `violation_windows` — when the law is actually broken |
| amber bar, timeline | `observable_windows` — when there is visual evidence |
| `t_event` / `t_obs` / `t_end` | the three clocks; they merge into one label when they coincide |

If `t_obs > t_event` the violation happened while the culprit was hidden — that gap is the
occlusion lag, and `occluder_pass` is the scenario built to produce it.

---

## 4. Command reference

Every subcommand takes `--config NAME`.

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `taxonomy` | print the taxonomy and **price a release** |
| `generate` | simulate + render + annotate, end to end |
| `annotate` | re-annotate a worker directory **without re-rendering** |
| `overlay` | the six-panel annotated video for one clip |
| `grid` | one family: valid vs every severity, every annotation view |
| `sheet` | one scenario: every family × every severity at once |
| `coverage` | every invalid clip in the release, tiled into one video |
| `validate` | schema + cross-checks over a whole release |
| `audit` | cells whose violation is **not visible** — candidates to drop |
| `config-path` | print the outdir a config resolves to |

```bash
# Taxonomy: 5 media, 24 families, 15 scenarios, 180 build cells
python -m physviol.cli taxonomy
python -m physviol.cli taxonomy -v                    # + every cell
python -m physviol.cli taxonomy --config v0_release   # + hours and clip counts

# Re-annotate without re-rendering -- picks up any annotation change for free
python -m physviol.cli annotate out/work/drop/0777 --outdir out/release

# Videos
python -m physviol.cli overlay  out/release/clips/.../invalid_solidity_strong
python -m physviol.cli grid     out/release/clips/physviol_v0/drop/0777 --family solidity
python -m physviol.cli sheet    out/release/clips/physviol_v0/drop/0777 --view energy
python -m physviol.cli coverage out/release

python -m physviol.cli validate out/release

python -m pytest tests/ -q                    # 1012 tests, no docker needed
python -m pytest tests/test_all_cells.py -q   # plans and applies all 180 cells
```

### `generate` flags

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--tier debug\|v0\|v1` | the resolution/length ladder — section 8 |
| `--complexity L0\|L1` | L0 solid background, L1 photographic HDRI (~5.5× the cost) |
| `--severity weak\|medium\|strong\|all` | which magnitude bins |
| `--variants N` | randomisations per cell |
| `--scenario X` / `--family Y` | restrict the matrix |
| `-n N` | stop after N cells |
| `--keep-going` | carry on past failures, list them at the end |
| `--window N` | force one violation duration; **leave unset** so each family scales with the clip |
| `--no-overlay` | skip the per-clip videos |
| `--outdir` / `--workdir` | where the release and the raw passes go |
| `--frames N` `--fps N` `--resolution N` `--spp N` | override one field of a tier — section 8 |

### The three videos

All three are laid out **wide**, and all three put every annotation view in one frame.

| video | rows | columns |
|---|---|---|
| `grid` | severity (valid, weak, medium, strong) | annotation view |
| `sheet` | annotation view | valid + every family of one scenario |
| `coverage` | scenario | family — **black where a cell is not built** |

Nine views, in the same order everywhere — `rgb`, `energy`, `seg`, `depth`, `flow`, `mask`,
`sev`, `causal`, `div` — so a grid cell, a sheet cell and an overlay panel read the same.
The order runs **evidence first** (what the renderer saw) then the **annotation** derived
from it.

Three timeline bars, keyed in every video that draws them:

| colour | window | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **blue** | `intervening` | we are actively changing something |
| **red** | `consequence` | the scene is still wrong as a result |
| **amber** | `observable` | a viewer could tell |

A `sheet` column is the single-clip overlay turned on its side, so reading across a row
compares the same annotation over every violation at the same instant. `coverage` is a fixed
scenario × family lattice rather than a reflowed block, so a missing cell is a black square
in a known place instead of a gap the tiles close up around.

`grid --views a,b,c` restricts the columns; `sheet --severity BIN` and `coverage --severity BIN` pick which bin to show.

### Running a worker in the container directly

```bash
# throughput probe (no assets downloaded, pure render cost)
bash docker/kubric.sh physviol/render/worker_smoke.py --resolution 256 --frames 8

# the real worker: simulate + inject + render both twins.
# --family takes a comma list; they share one scene build and one valid render.
bash docker/kubric.sh physviol/render/worker.py \
    --scenario drop --seed 777 --tier debug --complexity L0 \
    --family solidity,antigravity --severity strong --outdir out/work
```

`docker/kubric.sh` mounts the repo at `/kubric`, runs as your uid so output is not
root-owned, and prefers the pinned digest over `:latest`.

---

## 5. What a clip contains

Output lands in `out/release/clips/<release>/<scenario>/<seed>/{valid,invalid_<family>_<bin>}/`
(gitignored, so it never enters version control).

```
meta.json            labels, taxonomy, violation windows, severity, provenance
rgb.mp4              the video
overlay.mp4          annotated: mask + severity + clocks + window bar
timelines.npz        active[T], intervening[T], consequence[T], observable[T],
                     occluded[T], severity_t[T]
violation_mask.npz   bool [T,H,W]  <- the primary annotation: union over both twins
mask_invalid.npz     bool [T,H,W]  the culprit in the INVALID render only
reference_mask.npz   bool [T,H,W]  where the culprit SHOULD be (valid twin); on both clips
causal_mask.npz      uint8 [T,H,W] 0=none, 1=culprit, 2+=participants
severity_map.npz     f16  [T,H,W]  how badly, localised in space and time
residuals.npz        r (physical units), z (vs noise floor), s (bounded [0,1])
divergence_map.npz   f16  [T,H,W]  NOT the violation region -- see below
seg.npz              uint16 [T,H,W] instance ids, stable across frames = per-object tracks
depth.npz            f32  [T,H,W,1] metres (background is a ~1e10 sentinel, mask it)
flow_fwd/bwd.npz     f32  [T,H,W,2] pixels, (row, col)
normals.npz  object_coords.npz     uint16, 0..65535
energy.npz           mechanical energy + its three anomaly channels
energy_map.npz       f32  [T,H,W]  per-body energy, painted through the segmentation
bodies.npz           mass, velocity, momentum, inertia, height, kinetic, potential
grids.npz            masks + severity reduced to the latent token grid
traj.npz             the seam file: poses, velocities, contacts
```

**Every object's mask for the whole clip** comes out of `seg.npz` in one comparison —
segmentation ids are the declared ones and are stable across frames, so they *are* the
tracks:

```python
seg  = np.load("seg.npz")["seg"]                 # [T,H,W]
bods = np.load("bodies.npz")                     # ids and names together
for bid, name in zip(bods["body_ids"], bods["body_names"]):
    track = (seg == bid)                         # [T,H,W] bool, this body, every frame
```

Field reference: [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md).

**Three things to know before training on any of it:**

- **`divergence_map` is not the violation region.** It is `|valid − invalid|` in pixel space
  and it diverges *everywhere* downstream of the event. Use `violation_mask` and
  `severity_map`.
- **`violation_mask` is gated on visibility, not just on the window.** It answers "where can
  this be seen", so it is empty on frames where the violation is active but the culprit is
  hidden — or where the intervention has not yet moved a pixel. `timelines.active` is the
  ground-truth timeline; the gap between them is the observability lag, and it is the point.
- **Check `provenance.prefix_identical_verified`** rather than assuming twins are
  pixel-aligned.

---

## 6. How it is organised

Four levels — `python -m physviol.cli taxonomy` prints the live version:

```
DOMAIN     7   which physical law is at stake      identity, kinematics, contact,
                                                   dynamics, equilibrium, optical, global
FAMILY    17   the specific way it breaks          solidity, fission, ...
SCENARIO  14   the staged scene                    drop, occluder_pass, pour, ...
               (13 built; clutter_toss is deferred)
INSTANCE       scenario x family x seed x severity -> one valid/invalid pair
```

| scenario | what it stages | why it is in the set |
|---|---|---|
| `drop` | sphere or cube falls and bounces | simplest scenario with a real contact instant |
| `collision` | two spheres roll together | two bodies that both *ought* to respond |
| `toss` | ballistic arc, no contact | the clean control: `t_event == t_observable` |
| `tumble` | cube tumbling in free flight | a sphere cannot show rotation |
| `occluder_pass` | body passes behind a screen | the only source of observability lag |
| `ramp_slide` | block slides down an incline | sustained contact + friction |
| `rolling_ramp` | cube tumbles off a raised ramp | contact, then a short free flight |
| `stack_topple` | marginally stable stack | *surprising but lawful* — the control for false positives |
| `pyramid_impact` | cube dropped on a sphere pyramid | multi-body contact chain |
| `pendulum_swing` | bob on a rigid rod | constrained periodic motion (scripted; Kubric has no joints) |
| `resting_table` | bodies at rest on a table | static equilibrium; any motion is the violation |
| `shadow_track` | object translating under a key light | the only violation whose mask is not on the object |
| `pour` | 40 grains falling into an open box | **granular, never "fluid"** — see below |

Two orthogonal augmentation axes:

- **severity** — `weak` / `medium` / `strong`, set by the *intervention magnitude*, which is
  exact by construction. Named for how hard the law is bent, not for how hard the clip is to
  classify — those are different things, and conflating them is how difficulty splits go bad.
- **complexity** — `L0`..`L4`, mirroring the MOVi ladder. **L0 (solid background + sun) and
  L1 (photographic HDRI environment + dome ground) are built; L1 is the default.** L2–L4 add
  GSO objects, distractors and camera motion, and **raise if requested** rather than silently
  degrading. GSO (1033 objects) and HDRI Haven (509 environments) are verified reachable from
  the pinned container, so those levels need scenario code only.

**Why 19 files and not 238.** Scenarios and injectors are orthogonal and compose through the
trajectory seam — an injector edits `traj.npz`, per-body poses and velocities, which knows
nothing about the scene that produced it. So the project needs 13 scenario files + 6 injector
files (one per domain) + one shared geometry helper, not one file per scenario × family pair.
`antigravity` written once runs on every airborne scenario; adding a scenario makes every
compatible family available in it for free.

The corollary is that injectors must never branch on a scenario's *name*. They branch on
**state** — is this body moving, is it in contact, is it hidden — or on a **constraint the
scenario declares** in `spec.notes`. `newton1_inertia` halts a sliding block and shoves a
resting mug from one code path; `angular_momentum` asks the scenario to re-solve its own
pendulum arc rather than knowing what a pendulum is.

### No fluid at v0, and why

Tested rather than assumed: Blender 2.93.4 in the pinned image ships Mantaflow, but headless
scripted baking fails (`NameError: liquid_save_data_N` → `Manta::Error`), Kubric exposes no
fluid object, and a liquid's per-frame mesh state does not fit a pose-based trajectory seam.
`pour` is the v0 stand-in — a few dozen rigid grains that stream, pile and break up —
and it is labelled `physics_medium: "granular"`. `physviol validate` rejects any clip
claiming `"fluid"`. Real fluid and cloth are **Phase 3**, behind a newer Blender.

---

## 7. Orthogonality — what the labels guarantee

A clip labelled `solidity` has to contain solidity **and nothing else**, or the dataset
cannot support the claim "this model misses X". That is not free — it broke four separate
times while the injectors were being written, always the same way: an injector re-integrates a
body, the integrator does not know about the walls, and a `global_gravity` clip quietly
becomes a clip about solidity too.

So it is asserted. `taxonomy.EXCLUSIVE_LAWS` names the residuals with a clean zero baseline on
a lawful clip and the families entitled to move each one; `tests/test_orthogonality.py` fails
if any other family moves one, and fails again if an owner does *not* move the law it owns —
a tripwire nobody trips measures nothing.

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_orthogonality.py -q     # every cell, no docker, ~10 s
```

**Where the guarantee stops.** Families with an exclusive tripwire are provably clean. The
rest are separated by *staging*, not by residual: `antigravity`, `phantom_impulse`,
`newton1_inertia` all move `linear_momentum`, because they must —
bend a body's gravity and its momentum residual moves with it. Physics is not separable there
and pretending otherwise would be the wrong fix. What separates them is the situation, which a
model has to read from the image. [docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md) says which is
which, and what that means for a confusion matrix.

## 8. Tiers

| | `debug` | `v0` (`physviol_v0`) | `v1` (`physviol_v1`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| resolution | 128² | 512² | 512² |
| frames @ fps | 25 @ 12 | 89 @ 30 | 89 @ 30 |
| duration | 2.08 s | 2.97 s | 2.97 s |
| latent grid | 7×8×8 | 23×16×16 | 23×16×16 |
| complexity | `L0` | `L0` | **`L1`** |
| population | single | single | **single + multi** |
| published | never | yes | yes |

**v0 and v1 are the same tier geometry on purpose.** v1 is not a bigger render — it is the
same physics under harder conditions: photographic backgrounds and objects, and crowded
scenes. Making it a resolution step as well would confound the axes, since a model scoring
worse on v1 could be failing at realism, at clutter, or merely at an unfamiliar resolution.
Fixing the geometry is what makes the two **paired**. See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

**v0 is 30 fps** so the release downsamples cleanly to 15 and 10 without resampling, which a
12 fps master cannot do. 89 frames rather than 90 because every frame count must be `4k+1`
for exact VAE latent alignment, and 89 is the nearest that is.

Frame counts are all `4k+1` so the token-grid reduction aligns exactly with a video-DiT VAE's
4× temporal binning. **`debug` is the default** — iterate there.

The letters this project used to use (A/B/D) are retired: there was no C, and the ordering
the alphabet implies ran backwards from the one that matters. `scenarios.base.tier()` and
`generate` both recognise the old letters and say what each was renamed to.

**Any single dial can be overridden without inventing a tier.** The name records what
changed, so `v0+res128f25` never gets confused with `v0` in `meta.json`:

```bash
python -m physviol.cli generate --tier v0 --frames 25 --resolution 128
```

| flag | overrides | note |
|---|---|---|
| `--frames N` | clip length | **must be `4k+1`** — 13, 17, 21, 25, 29… A bad value is refused with the nearest two legal ones |
| `--fps N` | frame rate | violation windows are a *fraction* of the clip, so they scale with it |
| `--resolution N` | square render size | render time is roughly linear in pixel count |
| `--spp N` | Cycles samples/pixel | frame time ≈ `1.29 + 0.0074·spp` at 256², so only ~26% is sampling |

**Rendering is CPU and stays that way.** Frame time fits `T = 1.29 + 0.0074·spp` at 256², so
only ~26% is sampling — the only part OptiX would accelerate, capping a GPU build at ~1.37×
by Amdahl. Clip-level parallelism measures **1.92×** at width 4, for free. Details in
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) Part 0.

## 10. Where it is going

[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) — the medium axis that maps onto LikePhys, the perceptual
families still missing from v0 (`colour_shift`, `illumination_shift`), and what v1 is:
population, a realistic twin of every clip, and deeper randomisation.

## 11. Evaluating on it

[docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md) — which axes to report on, the four tasks the
annotations support, and what the orthogonality guarantee does and does not cover. The short
version: report **per family**, cross with **severity** and **complexity**, split by
`scene_id`, and never train on `divergence_map`.

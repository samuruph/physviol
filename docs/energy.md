# Energy annotation

**Status: built and shipping.** Numbers here are from real PyBullet rollouts at tier
`debug`, not estimates. `tests/test_energy.py` covers it host-side, no docker.

## Why

The taxonomy's third principle is *conservation of momentum and energy*, and until now the
only thing scoring it was `energy_at_contact`, which fires on one family. Energy is
computable **exactly** from the trajectory seam, for both twins, at negligible cost -- so it
can be both a descriptive channel a benchmark consumer reads and a second, independent
scorer for that principle.

It also cross-checks the taxonomy. `deformation` is volume-preserving and reads **0.00%**;
`immutability` scales volume and reads **+34%**. That is the mass-vs-shape split of
[taxonomy_v2.md](taxonomy_v2.md) showing up in an independent measurement.

## What energy

Total **mechanical** energy of the dynamic bodies:

```
E(t) = Σ_b  ½·m_b(t)·|v_b(t)|²  +  ½·ω_b(t)ᵀ·I_b(t)·ω_b(t)  +  m_b(t)·g·h_b(t)
```

- `v`, `ω`, `pos`, `quat` come straight off the trajectory. No estimation, no fitting.
- `h` is height along `-ĝ` from the scene's `floor_level`, so the datum is fixed per scene
  and absolute values are comparable between twins.
- `I` is the analytic inertia tensor of the primitive -- `⅖mr²` for a sphere,
  `⅓m(b²+c²)` per axis for a box of half-extents `(a,b,c)` -- rotated into world frame by
  the body's quaternion.
- Bodies with `present == False` contribute nothing. That is what makes `permanence` read
  −100%.

**Mass follows volume**: `m_b(t) = m_b(0) · Π scale_mul[t,b]`. This is a deliberate choice
and it is the one that keeps the annotation consistent with the taxonomy. A body that
doubles in size is depicting twice the matter, so it must carry twice the energy;
`deformation`'s squash is volume-preserving, so its product is exactly 1 and its energy does
not move. Every other family leaves `scale_mul` at 1 and is unaffected either way.

## The two channels

A passive rigid-body scene under gravity, contacts and friction can only **lose** mechanical
energy, and only **at a contact**. That gives two independent anomaly channels, and the
measurement shows they separate different families rather than restating each other.

### 1. Free-energy anomaly -- ΔE on frames with no contact

Energy that changes with nothing touching. No budget model needed; the lawful value is zero.

| | free-loss | free-gain |
|---|---|---|
| **valid twins** | **0.00%** | **0.00%** |
| solidity | 146% | 61% |
| non_parabolic | 48% | 32% |
| support | 47% | — |
| antigravity | 25% | 13% |
| angular_momentum | — | 12% |
| immutability | — | 9% |
| phantom_impulse | 9% | — |

### 2. Contact-budget anomaly -- ΔE at a contact beyond what is allowed

Energy may be lost at a contact, but only within a budget:

- **Restitution.** Normal-direction kinetic energy after a bounce is at most `e²` times
  before it. Gaining any is impossible. `superelastic` reads **−190%** here (a *gain*) while
  sitting at 0.06% in the free channel -- the exact inverse of `support`.
- **Friction.** Frictional dissipation over a step is bounded by `µ·m·g·Δs` for a body on a
  surface -- textbook, and it needs only µ, m, g and path length, all of which the seam
  carries exactly.

Contact *count* is not a signal on its own: valid clips dissipate 27% of `E₀` at contacts,
which is simply what inelastic collisions do. Only the excess over budget means anything.

## Noise floor

The largest frame-to-frame energy **increase** on a valid clip is **0.005% of E₀** -- that is
integrator drift and nothing else. Every violating family above is two to five orders of
magnitude clear of it, so this scores without a tuned threshold. It still goes through
`bounded_score(baseline=r_valid)` like every other law, so a scenario with unusual drift is
scored against its own twin rather than against a global constant.

## What ships

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `energy.npz` | `total[T]`, `kinetic_translational[T]`, `kinetic_rotational[T]`, `potential[T]`, `by_body[T,B]`, `body_ids[B]`, `dissipated[T]`, `free_anomaly[T]`, `contact_anomaly[T]`, `excess_loss[T]` |
| `energy_map.npz` | `energy[T,H,W]` -- each body's energy painted onto its pixels through the segmentation pass, the same mechanism `severity_map` already uses |
| `meta.json` | an `energy` block: `E0`, `E_end`, `peak_free_anomaly`, `peak_contact_anomaly`, `total_dissipated`, all normalised by `E₀` as well as in joules |

`energy_map` is per-body constant within a body's silhouette. For a rigid body that is the
honest spatial resolution -- energy is not a field inside a rigid body, and pretending
otherwise would invent structure the physics does not have.

## Shipped for every family, including the ones that should read zero

A flat trace on `colour_shift` is a **positive, falsifiable statement**: this violation
provably does not touch energy. Omitting it would turn a measured fact into an untested
assumption, and it is what lets the orthogonality test check energy bidirectionally the way
it already checks the exclusive laws.

## Known limits

- **Scripted scenarios.** `pendulum_swing` and `shadow_track` drive a body kinematically, so
  the conservation invariant does not apply to those bodies and the clip-level claim must
  exclude them. Handled by flagging, not by hiding the numbers.
- **PyBullet's `impulse` field may be a force.** Noted in CLAUDE.md and the cause of an
  earlier residual bimodality. The free-energy channel deliberately needs no force at all,
  and the restitution budget uses velocities rather than the reported impulse, so neither
  depends on resolving this.


## The third channel: excess loss

Energy may be lost at a contact, but only up to the kinetic energy actually available at the
**start** of the step. A perfectly inelastic stop takes all of it and no more; potential
energy cannot be dissipated at all, only converted by the body moving, which the balance
already accounts for.

Getting that end wrong is worth recording: budgeting against the kinetic energy at the *end*
of the step reads 77% excess loss on a perfectly lawful `drop`, because at the impact frame
the ball has already stopped and every joule the floor legitimately absorbed looks
unexplained.

This channel is deliberately not tuned to catch everything. `newton1_inertia` halts a body on
the ground, which costs exactly its kinetic energy and is therefore within budget — a body
stopping dead is energetically identical to one that hit something. That is a momentum
violation and `linear_momentum` is what scores it.

## Measured, per family

Peak anomaly as % of `E0`, worst scenario per family, from real rollouts:

| family | free | gain at contact | excess loss |
|---|---|---|---|
| immutability | — | **768** | — |
| support | — | **400** | — |
| fission | — | **304** | — |
| superelastic | — | **191** | — |
| non_parabolic | **48** | 157 | 1 |
| solidity | **146** | — | — |
| global_gravity | — | **145** | — |
| phantom_impulse | — | **111** | — |
| dissolve / permanence | — | — | **70** |
| fusion | — | 52 | 36 |
| time_slip | — | **38** | — |
| newton2_mass | — | 25 | — |
| antigravity | 20 | 13 | 4 |
| friction | — | 14 | — |
| angular_momentum | **14** | — | — |
| newton1_inertia | — | 7 | — |
| **colour_shift, continuity, deformation, newton3_reaction** | **at the valid floor** | | |

Valid-clip floors, worst of all three channels: `occluder_pass` 0.000%, `barrier_pass`
0.005%, `collision` 0.007%, `pendulum_swing` 0.31%, `drop` 1.7% (a hard impact strains the
discrete-time balance).

Four families sit at the floor and three of them should: `colour_shift` and `deformation` are
appearance and volume-preserving shape, and `continuity` teleports a body without changing
its height or speed. `newton3_reaction` is the interesting one — suppressing one body's
response breaks momentum without necessarily moving the energy budget, which is a real
statement about the violation rather than a gap in the measurement.

## The scored law is narrower than the shipped trace

`energy_balance` is the **per-body free-energy anomaly**: this body's energy moved while
nothing was touching it. That is the only one of the three channels honestly attributable to
a single body — a body's energy may legitimately jump at a contact because a partner supplied
it, and untangling that needs pairwise bookkeeping the seam does not carry.

So the law claims less than `energy.npz` shows, on purpose. `permanence` and `dissolve` are a
scene-level excess loss and the law does not claim them; `energy.npz` and the `meta.json`
block do.


## Visualisation

The `ENERGY` panel appears in three places, all driven by the same arrays:

- **`physviol overlay`** — the energy map beside the other passes, with `E(t)` drawn inside
  it as a two-line curve: the clip in red, its valid twin in green, playhead on the current
  frame, and the live anomaly percentage when it exceeds 1%. The map answers "where is the
  energy"; the curve answers "what did it do", which is the question the annotation exists
  for. A violation that creates energy is a *step in a line*, and no amount of colouring
  pixels shows a step.
- **`physviol grid --views energy`** — an ENERGY row beside the other annotation rows.
- **`physviol sheet --view energy`** — every family of a scenario at once, each cell showing
  its own `E(t)` in joules.

The map uses VIRIDIS, deliberately not the severity map's INFERNO: the two sit side by side
and answer different questions, so they must not be mistakable for one another at a glance.

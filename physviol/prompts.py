"""Textual prompts for v0 -- docs/PLAN.md is silent on captions, this is new.

One valid-physics caption template per scenario (LikePhys style: a short noun
phrase naming the scene and what happens in it, e.g. their "two balls
colliding with each other"), with `{color}`/`{shape}` slots that
`compose_prompt` fills from whatever a given clip actually sampled -- see
`physviol/scenarios/base.py::SceneSpec.to_dict` for where `color` and `kind`
reach `spec_d`. `physviol/annotate/pipeline.py::_build_meta` calls
`compose_prompt` once per clip and writes the result to `meta.json["prompt"]`,
so two clips of the same scenario read differently when they sampled
differently ("a red cube dropping..." vs "a blue ball dropping...").

`SUBJECTS` says which body's shape/color a scenario's template cares about.
Left out of `SUBJECTS` entirely (`stack_topple`, `pour`) means the template
has no `{color}`/`{shape}` slot -- naming one block's color in a stack of
differently-colored ones, or one grain's out of a pour, does not read as a
description of the scene. `collision` names only `ball_a`: its two balls are
sampled from one shared shape/color draw on purpose (see the "IDENTICAL"
comment in `collision.py`), so either one describes both.

Invalid-clip captions are deliberately not generated here. A hand-written
generic violation clause per family does not know which body in a
multi-body scenario the violation acts on, so it reads as vague at best and
wrong at worst -- e.g. `solidity` on `collision` cannot say which of the two
balls passes through the other. That precision already lives in
`meta.json`'s `violation` block. The plan is to caption invalid clips with a
VLM against the rendered frames instead, later; see docs/PLAN.md.

Run as a script to (re)write `docs/prompts_v0.json` -- the templates
themselves, placeholders and all, not any one clip's filled-in prompt:

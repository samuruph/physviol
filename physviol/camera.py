    **The apex of a ballistic arc is not ours to choose.** A body airborne for

    So when the clip length doubled (13 -> 25 frames at Tier D, 25 -> 49 at
    Tier A) the arcs got *four* times taller while the cameras stayed where they
    had been hand-tuned for the short clips, and `toss` and `tumble` threw their

    at Tier D, and 1% and 0% at Tier A. Every violation staged mid-flight was
    being injected off-screen.

    The fix is to stop hand-tuning the camera and derive it, which also makes
    the two scenarios scale-invariant: a longer clip is the *same shot* of a
    bigger scene from further away, so the actor covers the same pixels at
    every tier and a bug found at Tier D looks the same at Tier A.

"""Step PyBullet forward from a state we choose -- the simulated-intervention seam.

Until now every injector edited a *finished* trajectory, and everything after
`t_event` was re-integrated by our own resolver against sphere and box
approximations taken from the scene spec. That resolver does not know about
`scale_mul`, does not know that a teleported body is already past the wall, and
does not produce real contacts. So a clip could show a ball bouncing off a
barrier it had been moved beyond, or two bodies "colliding" without touching.

Kubric's `simulator.run(frame_start, frame_end)` continues from whatever state
the physics client is currently in rather than resetting it, so the honest fix
was available all along: put the world back to the valid state at `t_event`,
make the intervention a change the *simulator* honours, and let PyBullet run.
Prefix identity is untouched, because frames before `t_event` are copied from
the valid rollout verbatim.

This module is the loop. It exists rather than calling `simulator.run` because
`run` has no per-step hook, and a per-body gravity change -- `antigravity`,
`support` -- is a counter-force that must be applied on every substep.

Container-side only: it imports nothing, but it is handed a live Kubric
simulator.

    The one thing PyBullet genuinely cannot do in place: there is no API to
    rescale a collision shape, which is why `deformation` and `immutability`
    were the two families that edited a finished trajectory instead of staging
    themselves. That cost exactly what the trajectory path always costs -- the
    render knew the body had changed size and the physics did not, so a
    shrunken cube stopped touching the floor it was standing on and a swollen
    ball grew half-way into the barrier beside it.

    What PyBullet *can* do is create a new body and remove an old one, mid-run,
    carrying the pose and both velocities across. So this parks the declared
    body out of the world and stands a correctly-sized **proxy** in its place,
    swapping the proxy again on each frame of a resize ramp. From `t_event` on
    the actor's contacts, its resting height and everything it runs into come
    from the solver at its *current* size.

    The declared body is parked rather than removed because Kubric's traitlet
    setters close over its PyBullet index at scene-build time: remove it and the
    next `obj.position = ...` writes to a body that no longer exists. Parking
    keeps every one of those setters valid, and `linked_objects` -- a plain
    dict, checked in the image -- is retargeted so that `_body_index_map`, and

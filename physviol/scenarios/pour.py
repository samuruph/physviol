"""`pour` -- a loose column of small spheres falls into an open box.

**This is not a fluid and must never be labelled one.** True liquid was tested
against the pinned image and does not work: Blender 2.93.4 ships Mantaflow but
headless baking fails (`NameError: liquid_save_data_N` -> `Manta::Error`),
Kubric exposes no fluid object, and a liquid does not fit a pose-based
trajectory seam in any case. So v0 ships the honest neighbour -- a few dozen
rigid grains, which streams, piles and breaks up like a granular medium -- and
labels it `physics_medium: "granular"`. `physviol validate` rejects any clip
claiming `"fluid"` at schema v0. Real fluid and cloth are Phase 3, behind a
newer Blender.

Every grain is an `actor`, so a violation here acts on the whole medium rather
than singling out one bead: a `global_gravity` or `antigravity` clip shows the
pour itself misbehaving, which is the point.

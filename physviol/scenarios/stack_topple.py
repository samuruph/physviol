"""`stack_topple` -- a marginally stable stack that falls over on its own.

The valid clip already contains dramatic motion, which is the point: it is the
control for "surprising but lawful". A model that flags every clip where
something collapses is not detecting violations, and this scenario is where
that shows up. Grounded in IntPhys 2 / LikePhys stability.

"""`rolling_ramp` -- a cube tumbles down a raised ramp and off its lip.

Two regimes in one clip, deliberately: sustained contact on the slab, then a
short free flight after the lip. `friction` and `newton1_inertia` fire in the
first; `angular_momentum` needs the second, because a body in contact with the
ground can change its spin lawfully and only a change made in mid-air is
unexplained.

A cube rather than a ball for the same reason `tumble` uses one: a uniformly
coloured sphere renders identically however it is spinning.

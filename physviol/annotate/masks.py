"""Spatiotemporal masks -- docs/PLAN.md 3.3.

The primary annotation. Every mask is [T, H, W]: a value per pixel per frame, so
"where" and "when" are answered by one array.

**The union rule.** A naive "pixels of the culprit in the invalid render" is
wrong for a sixth of the taxonomy -- a vanished body has *no* invalid-side
pixels precisely because it vanished, and a teleported one is in two places. So

    violation_mask[t] = footprint(culprit, invalid, t) | footprint(culprit, valid, t)

which handles vanish (valid side only), spawn (invalid side only) and teleport
(both, disjoint) with one rule. It is well-defined only because the twins are
pixel-aligned and share instance indexing -- prefix identity paying off.

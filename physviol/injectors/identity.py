    is "it faded out of existence". They also differ in what a model has to
    notice -- an instant removal is a single-frame discontinuity, a dissolve is
    a trend across several.

    **Optical, not geometric**: the body keeps its size and shape and simply
    stops being opaque. The renderer mixes its shaded surface with a Transparent
    BSDF and keyframes the blend -- measured working in the pinned image, see
    `render/probe_opacity.py`, which also records that the Principled BSDF's own
    alpha input does nothing here and why it took three attempts to find that
    out.

    Fading alone is not enough to *remove* it, though, so the body is dropped
    from the scene once it is invisible. Cryptomatte tracks geometry, so a
    perfectly transparent body still reports every one of its pixels in
    `seg.npz`; leaving it there would mean the mask claimed an object that is no
    longer visible anywhere in the frame.

    Distinct from `immutability`, which settles at a new size and stays there,

    straight through the occluding screen; `global_gravity` on a pyramid sent
    spheres through the cube that struck them; two balls under `newton3` ended
    up sharing the same space. Each of those clips carried one violation label
    and depicted two, which makes the families useless for measuring anything
    independently.

    Two kinds of obstacle, both approximate on purpose:

    * **static boxes**, axis-aligned. Rotated ones -- ramps -- are skipped
      rather than approximated, because an AABB around a tilted slab is much
      bigger than the slab and would push bodies out of mid-air. A body sliding
      on a ramp is held up by `floor_fn` instead.
    * **other dynamic bodies**, as spheres of their bounding radius, following
      their *valid* trajectory. Exact for the bodies an injector leaves alone,
      which is the case that matters; bodies being re-integrated together are
      handled by stepping them jointly instead.

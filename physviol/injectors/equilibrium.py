    **The direction of this family changed, and it is worth saying why.** It
    used to claim the other half of the axis -- *less* grip than declared, so a
    body fails to slow as it should -- on the reasoning that "more grip" at its
    limit is a body stopping dead, which is `newton1_inertia`. Measured in the
    pinned image, the half it kept is not available: `barrier_pass`,
    `collision` and `occluder_pass` all give their actor a friction of 0.02 to
    0.05 so that it rolls freely, and taking that to 0.001 moves the ball by
    0.11 m over three seconds. You reported all three as barely visible, and
    that is the number behind it -- there is no headroom below a coefficient
    that is already almost zero.

    The other half has plenty, and it is not `newton1_inertia`. That family
    removes a body's velocity *between two frames* with nothing touching it;
    this one decelerates it over half a second while it is in continuous contact
    with a surface, which is exactly the signature of friction and exactly what
    the `friction` law measures. What is wrong is that nothing in the image
    justifies the grip: a ball rolls onto ordinary floor and stops as though it
    had rolled onto carpet.

    Staged as coefficients, and **rolling friction as well as lateral**. That is
    the measurement that decides it: lateral friction alone hardly touches a
    rolling sphere, because a rolling contact is not sliding. The two together
    take the same ball from 2.51 m of travel to 0.80 m and leave it at rest.

    The host-side approximation replays the body's own lawful path at a reduced
    rate rather than re-integrating it, which guarantees it stays on the surface
    it was travelling along: a ramp is not a horizontal plane, so re-integrating
    under gravity puts the block in mid-air beside its ramp -- a support

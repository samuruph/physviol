    Severity is the peak deviation `|1 - alpha|`: 0 is normal gravity, 1 is
    weightless, 2 is gravity fully reversed.

    Two properties worth being explicit about, because the obvious
    implementation gets both wrong:

    * **The floor stays solid.** Changing gravity must not also drop the actor
      through the ground -- that is a *solidity* violation, and a clip carrying
      two violations while annotating one is worse than useless.
    * **The intervention has a shape.** Alpha ramps from 1 up to its peak and
      back to 1 over the window, after which the actor obeys real physics
      again. So the residual, and with it `severity_map`, traces a curve over
      time instead of sitting at a single value for the rest of the clip.

    **Every bin reverses the actor's direction**; they differ in how hard. A
    bin whose only effect is that things fall a bit slower is indistinguishable
    from a shutter-speed change, so all three are qualitative claims -- the body
    turns around and comes back -- and severity is how violently. When the
    geometry cannot host that, the *window* shortens rather than the reversal
    weakening (see `_fit_window_to_frame`).

    **It acts on exactly one body, never the whole scene.** That is the entire
    difference from `global_gravity`, and it is invisible unless something else
    in the frame is still falling normally -- which is why the compatibility
    matrix pairs the two with different scenarios, and why both only become
    fully legible at `--population multi`.

        the whole window however hard gravity is reversed. That is how
        `pour x antigravity` came out with a clean-looking plan and a
        severity of exactly zero -- it had picked a grain that had already

        Preferring the longest airborne run also keeps the choice deterministic

    """A body stalls in place, then resumes exactly where it left off.

    The dataset's one *temporal* violation, and it is deliberately not the one
    LikePhys ships. Their Temporal Continuity row is frame shuffling, which is
    an encoding artifact: it has no per-body residual, it cannot carry a mask
    because every pixel changes at once, and a detector wins on it from
    low-level statistics without doing any physics -- exactly the shortcut the
    artifact-probe control exists to catch. So the principle is staged as
    physics instead.

    Distinct from both its neighbours, and not by a hair:

    - Not `newton1_inertia`, which destroys momentum permanently -- the body
      stops and *stays* stopped. This one hands the momentum back, same
      direction and same magnitude, which no contact can do. There are two
      uncaused events, at the start of the stall and at its end.
    - Not `continuity`, because nothing jumps in space. Same path, same route,
      traversed with a pause in it, so `position_continuity` reads zero
      throughout.

    Two constraints came out of building it, both of which would otherwise ship
    a second unlabelled violation in the clip:

    1. **The body must be supported, never airborne.** A body that freezes in
       mid-air is also hovering, so `free_fall` fires and the clip is a
       gravitation violation too. Hence `requires=('sliding',)`.
    2. **The stall must come after the body's last contact with another dynamic
       body.** The shift persists to the end of the clip, so a collision that
       happens after it would have one participant arriving late while the
       other reacts on time -- the struck ball moving before it is struck.
       Static contacts are fine: a wall is there on every frame, so meeting it
       late is still meeting it lawfully.

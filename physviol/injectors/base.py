"""Injectors -- docs/PLAN.md Part 2 / Part 4.

An injector edits a **trajectory**, never the simulator's rng. That is what makes
the valid prefix bit-identical by construction rather than by hope: the invalid
trajectory literally *is* the valid one up to `t_event`.

Two-phase API, because an injector generally has to look at the valid rollout
before it can choose a sensible `t_event` (you cannot break a contact before the
contact happens):

        A violation with a shape, not a step: it comes on, sustains, releases,

        half the window, so most of it is ramp -- with the longer clips the
        tiers now use, that reads as a body drifting up and settling back rather
        than being yanked. The residual traces the
        same shape, which is what a per-frame severity field is for.

        Deliberately a trapezoid rather than a raised cosine. A cosine only
        touches its peak instantaneously, so the *mean* effect over the window
        is (base + peak) / 2 -- half the strength the bin advertises. On a body
        already moving fast that is not enough to visibly change its motion, and
        the strongest bin ends up looking like the weakest. Holding at the peak
        makes the advertised magnitude the one actually applied.

**Precedence is CLI > config > argparse default.** A flag you type always wins,
so a config is a starting point you can lean on, never something that quietly
overrides what you asked for. That ordering is the whole reason this module
exists rather than a shell alias: an alias cannot be partially overridden.

Host-side only. Nothing the container imports may depend on PyYAML -- the
container's Python is 3.9 with Kubric's own pinned set, and `taxonomy.py` and
`scenarios/` are imported on both sides of the seam. `cli.py` is not.

    Unknown keys **in a command's own block** are an error, not a warning. A

    does, and being able to trust the file at a glance is the entire point.

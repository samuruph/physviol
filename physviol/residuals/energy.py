"""Mechanical energy from the trajectory seam -- docs/energy.md.

Exact, not estimated: every term comes straight off `traj.npz` and the scene
spec. Runs host-side, needs no renderer and no simulator.

The point of the module is the two *anomaly* channels, which are what a
benchmark scores against. A passive rigid-body scene under gravity, contacts and
friction can only lose mechanical energy, and only at a contact -- so energy
that moves on a contact-free frame, or moves at a contact by more than
restitution and friction permit, is unphysical by construction rather than by a
tuned threshold. Measured floor on valid clips: 0.005% of E0.

    #    the impact frame the ball has already stopped, so its remaining kinetic
    #    energy is nearly zero and every joule the floor legitimately absorbed
    #    looks unexplained.
    #
    # 2. Potential energy RELEASED during the step. A body in contact can settle
    #    downward and have that energy absorbed immediately, within the frame.
    #    On `drop` the ball sinks 4.7 cm into the solver's contact tolerance as
    #    it comes to rest and loses 1.310 J while holding only 0.850 J of
    #    kinetic energy -- the missing 0.461 J is exactly m*g*0.047. Without
    #    this term that settling reads as a 1.7% violation on every clip that
    #    ends at rest, which is most of them.
